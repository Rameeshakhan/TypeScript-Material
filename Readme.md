The quirkiy behavior of Js. 
It should not allow adding two different datatypes

The typeScript is all about Type Safety.

What TypeScript do is 'Static Checking' 

As you write the code it will check for language types and highlight the problematic area. this is not being done in javaScript unless you run the code in chrome or in a node environment. 

TypeScript is a development tool, your code still run in JS.

we can degine the function in type script in a more safer format.
Like assigning data types to arguments that will be passed and assigning data types to the return type of a function , pretty cool right ? 

### See this as an example
